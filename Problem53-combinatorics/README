Problem:
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, ^5C[3] = 10.

In general, 

^nC[r] = n!/(r!(n-r)!) where r <= n, n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*3*2*1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: ^23C[10] = 1144066.

How many values of ^nC[r], for 1 <= n <= 100, are greater than one-million?


Solution:
Simply calculating the factorials of numbers would exceed the limit of 2^64-1 in both the numerator
and denominator in some occations.

For this reason, must split up what the factorials would be and remove common factors as n!/(n-2)! 
is going to be n*(n-1) since every other term would get cancelled out. 

Furthermore, since there are two factors on the bottom, we must split up what would be multiplied out
into their prime factors and divide them out, further simplifying the problem. 

Once finished, multiply the denominator by 1,000,000. Then multiply the numerator until either it is
greater than the product of denominator and 1,000,000 or until there are no numbers left to multiply.
