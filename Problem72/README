Problem 72

Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.

How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000?


--------------------------------------------------------
Alright so this one should be fairly easy. On the wiki page for Farey Sequences,
the cardinality of the sequence is defined as 
|Fn| = 1 + sum(m=1 to n, euler's totient of m)

As we know, the sum of an increasing sequence is 1/2 * m * (m+1)

So, we should be able to just plug in 1,000,000 to the equation: 1 + (1/2 * phi(m) * (phi(m) + 1)) and get the answer

--------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE
Using the simple summation formula didn't work as I had forgotten that it 
is only for arithmatic progressions

Let's see what the mobius function is all about...
