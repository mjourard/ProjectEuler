PROBLEM 71

Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. 
If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

Alright, so a bit of googling lead me to Farey Sequences and Stern-Bercot trees.

A Farey sequence of order n is defined as the completely reduced fractions from 0 to 1 which, when in lowest terms, 
have denominators less than or equal to n, arranged in order of increasing size.

So when you look at the above sequence, it is a farey sequence.

A Stern-Barcot tree is an infinite-complete binary tree of all lowest term fractional representation of positive rational numbers.
