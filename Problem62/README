*********PROBLEM**************
The cube, 41063625 (345^3), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (384^3) and 66430125 (405^3). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.




********SOLUTION************
Alright, so the idea is to increment a base number, cube it, and then compare the number of occurances of each digit. Then, create a string that represents the greatest permutation of the cube.
This is a key to a dictionary, and the value of the dictionary will be a 2-tuple, with the first element being the smallest base number to generate the cube permutation, and the second being a list of the cubes found 
so far that generates the string.
