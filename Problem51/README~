By replacing the 1st digit of *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 
13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, 
this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, 
yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. 
Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) 
with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family. 






-------------------------PROBLEM SOLVING--------------------------------
Assuming that for every prime k < 56003, they are part of a prime family less than 7. So, start with 
56003.

Increase each number by 2
if prime:
replace at first one digit, starting with the tens and going to the last digit.
Tens and not ones because any number ending in 2, 4, 5, 8 aren't prime, and you'll have to use 8
of the 10 digits from 0-9.


Then start replacing combinations of 2 digits, then 3 digits, then 4 digits, etc.
If 3 of the replacements aren't prime, move onto the next replacement 
Once you get to replacing all digits-1, move onto the next number.

order of replacement: 
tens, tens+hundreds, tens+thousands, tens+tenthousands, tens+hundredThousands,
tens+hundreds+thousands, tens+hundreds+tenthousands, tens+hunreds+hundredThousands,
tens+thousands+tenthousands,tens+thousands+hundredthousands, tens+tenthousands+hundredThousands,
tens+hundreds+thousands+tenthousands
hundreds+thousands+tenthousands, hundreds+thousands+hundredThousands, 
hundreds+tenthousands+hundredThousands,
