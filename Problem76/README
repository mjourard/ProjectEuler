It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

4 + 1
3 + 2
3 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?

---------------------------------------------------
Should be able to just write a function that subtracts 1 from the lowest number
in the sequence, and then if it can't (would make it 0), then subtract 
from the next lowest

Repeat until the list consists of all 1's.
